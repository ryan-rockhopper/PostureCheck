# Posture Check
The purpose of this program is to play a sound after a user specified amount of minutes. When that sound plays, the user should know to sit more upright and correct their posture. This will prevent back pain at the end of a long day of working. Ideally, the user will just get used to checking every so often and will no longer need this program.
